## TrustSheild OS™ Supabase Setup (Run 8)

### SQL File Location

```
sql_7_trustsheild_supabase_setup.sql.txt
```

Located in the project root alongside the other `sql_*.txt` files.

### How to Run

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Go to **SQL Editor**.
3. Open `sql_7_trustsheild_supabase_setup.sql.txt`.
4. Run **each section in order** (Extensions → Functions → Tables → Indexes → Triggers → RLS → Policies → Verification).
5. Run the **Verification Queries** (Section 9) to confirm the schema is correct.
6. Do NOT run the rollback section unless explicitly reverting.

### Important Security Notes

- **RLS is ENABLED** on all 23 user-facing tables.
- All policies use `user_has_org_access()` — authenticated users only see records belonging to their organisation.
- **NEVER** place `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the frontend.
- Use only the public **anon key** in the frontend, **after** verifying RLS policies are correctly configured.
- No anonymous full-access policies exist. No broad "allow all" policies exist.

### Tables Created (23)

`organisations` · `profiles` · `tracked_entities` · `reputation_cases` · `crisis_incidents` · `pwa_identities` · `pwa_pairing_sessions` · `pwa_tasks` · `pwa_task_updates` · `live_update_feed` · `evidence_items` · `response_drafts` · `response_draft_reviews` · `stakeholder_updates` · `escalation_requests` · `backend_provider_configs` · `api_provider_configs` · `entity_provider_map` · `api_test_results` · `sync_events` · `ai_agent_logs` · `reports` · `audit_logs`

### Run Status

- **Run 8** — SQL file created. No live backend connection yet.
- **Run 9** — Will wire Supabase client + dashboard ↔ PWA sync engine.

### Ethical Notice

Monitored entities must be owned brands, authorised clients, or public information sources only. No private surveillance, harassment, doxxing, or unauthorised tracking. AI guidance is advisory and must be reviewed by a responsible human before action.

## TrustSheild OS™ Sync Setup (Run 9)

- **Demo/local sync** works without any backend — dashboard and PWA share the same local SSOT.
- **Live sync** requires backend provider configuration (Backend tab in Command Dashboard).
- **Supabase live sync** requires executing `sql_7_trustsheild_supabase_setup.sql.txt` first, then configuring Project URL + anon key.
- **RLS must remain enabled** — never disable RLS policies.
- **Use anon key only** in frontend configuration. Service role key must never be used in frontend.
- **Offline queue** stores pending PWA submissions locally until sync is available (`trustsheild_sync_queue`).
- **Data freshness warnings** are shown when backend is not connected or queue is pending.
- Sync aligns with: `sql_7_trustsheild_supabase_setup.sql.txt`
